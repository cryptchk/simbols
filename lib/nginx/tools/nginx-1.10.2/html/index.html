Utilizing 2 IPv6 Addresses connected through one IPv4 Address or 32 Bit Block, an IPv9 Addressing Scheme can be created<br/>


DH/DL Algorithm, exchange Mac Addresses forming a Mac Address with a NON (Non Oppresive Niveau) to create two new Static IPv6 Addresses to form an IPv9 connection, dependent on the 32 Bit Block (Create InterLANs this way) <br/>


Creates the ability to host a Public WhiteNet IPv4 Node and perform GreyNet Transactions, while still being in control of our data <br/>


This would be called a Mesh Transaction </br>


Otherwise, utilize the 32 Bit Block to perform GreyNet Transfers, Connections, or Transactions </br>
